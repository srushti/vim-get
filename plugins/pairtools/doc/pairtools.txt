*1.* Foreword                                           *pairtools-foreword*

You might ask why another plugin for pair-closing and pair-surrounding? I
decided to start the coding of this plugin after a trial period with different
other plugins such as AutoClose, delimitMate and al., which didn't let me set 
the different options and pairs based on filetypes as I like it. It was also 
a great opportunity for me to learn Vim script as I started learning Vim a 
few weeks before starting this plugin.

You may or may not find features you are already familiar with or from other 
similar plugins. This is a continuously work in progress.

Bugs can be report on https://github.com/MartinLafreniere/PairTools.

You can reach me at pairtools@gmail.com for questions, comments and feature 
requests. I should be able to answer you within a few days.
 
==============================================================================
*2.* Introduction                                       *pairtools-intro*

The main goal of the PairTools plugin is to offer a generic plugin that will
work with any language and that can be configured based on the current
filetype (or language). The PairTools plugin offers the following features to 
the user:

        - Automatically close an opening character of a defined pair
        - Step out of the current pair at closing character
        - Delete opening character with backspace deletes the pair
        - Inline surrounding with a defined-pair in visual mode
        - Block surrounding with a defined-pair in visual mode
        - Carriage return expansion within an empty defined pair
        - Define syntax fields to prevent some features (aka Antimagic Field)
        - Per filetype features auto-configuration using ftplugin directory

The surround feature is not an attempt to replace the excellent surround.vim
plugin which can do multi-character pairs. PairTools surround only works with
single-character pairs. If the surround features your are looking for are not
limited to single-character pairs, disable the surround feature of PairTools
and use surround.vim along with this plugin.

==============================================================================
*3.* Options                                            *pairtools-options*

This section merely list the options for each feature. More information is
available in the |pairtools-features| section.

The PairTools plugin allows the user to define options per filetype. To define 
these filetype options the user must create a {filetypename}.vim in the
ftplugin directory from the first location in 'runtimepath'. The following
examples are good candidates under Linux and Windows:

        Linux:   ~/.vim/ftplugin/ 
        Windows: $HOME\vimfiles\ftplugin\

For example, if the user wants to define options for the C++ filetype, he must
create a cpp.vim in his ftplugin directory. When the file already exists the
user can add his PairTools options inside it, along with the other stuff.

Once a file of the given filetype is loaded into a vim buffer, the PairTools
options will be configured for that filetype. 

Note: All options are enabled by default.

While describing the options, we will use the following notation to write the
name of an option: >

	let g:{filetype}_option = 1
<
The {filetype} placeholder must be replace by your filetype name. For example,
this auto-close option would be defined for the C++ filetype in cpp.vim as: >

	let g:cpp_autoclose = 1
<

The PairTool plugin uses the standard Vim way to disable a plugin. To do so
simply set in you vimrc file the following line: >
	
	let g:loaded_PairTools = 1
<
This will prevent the plugin from loading.

It is also possible to disable or enable the plugin per filetype: >

        " Enable pairtools for current filetype
        let g:{filetype}_pairtools = 1
        " Disable pairtools for current filetype
        let g:{filetype}_pairtools = 0
<
The pairs to be used with most of the features are defined using a string. To
customize your own pairs you can define this string as follow: >

	let g:{filetype}_closepairs = "(:),':'"
<
The pairs string defaults to: >

        "(:),{:},[:],\":\",':'"
<
The |auto-close| and |forced-pairs| features can be enabled/disabled as follow: >

        " Enable auto-close
	let g:{filetype}_autoclose = 1
	" Disable auto-close
	let g:{filetype}_autoclose = 0
<
It is possible to define another mapping for the |forced-pairs| features. It can
be set using the follow declaration: >

        let g:{filetype}_forcedpairskey = "key"
<
More information on what to map is provided in the |forced-pairs| section.

It is possible to define some syntax fields where you want to prevent the 
auto-closing mechanism and related features. The PairTools plugin uses a 
feature called Antimagic Field which allow you to define these syntax fields: >

	let g:{filetype}_antimagicfield = "String,Comment,Special"
<
The |antimagic-field| defaults to: >

        "Comment,String"
<
The |antimagic-field| feature can be enabled/disabled as follow: >

	" Enable Antimagic Field
	let g:{filetype}_antimagic = 1
	" Disable Antimagic Field
	let g:{filetpye}_antimagic = 0
<
The |smart-close| feature can be set as follow: >

        let g:{filetype}_smartcloserules = '\w,^,\$'
<
And it can be turned on/off: >

        " Enable Smart-Close
        let g:{filetype}_smartclose = 1
        " Disable Smart-Close
        let g:{filetype}_smartclose = 0
<
The |pair-deletion| feature can be enabled/disabled as follow: >

	" Enable Pair Deletion
	let g:{filetype}_pairdeletion = 1
	" Disable Pair Deletion
	let g:{filetype}_pairdeletion = 0
<
The |surround| feature (both inline and block) can enabled/disabled as follow: >

	" Enable Surround
	let g:{filetype}_surround = 1
	" Disable Surround
	let g:{filetype}_surround = 0
<
The |carriage-return-expansion| feature can be enabled/disable as follow: >

	" Enable Carriage Return Expansion
	let g:{filetype}_crexpand = 1
	" Disable Carriage Return Expansion
	let g:{filetype}_crexpand = 0
>
==============================================================================
*4.* Features                                           *pairtools-features*

The following section describe each feature. In the examples, the cursor is
represented using the bar (|).

*4.1* Auto-Close                                                *pt-auto-close*

The auto-close feature automatically close a pair based on its opening
character. The following example shows the process:

Suppose we have the following line:

	int function|

When the user press an opening '(' the line becomes:

	int function(|)

Let the user add an argument:
	
	int function(int arg|)

To automatically step out of the enclosing paren, the user type ')':

	int function(int arg)|

Note: This feature is compatible with the undo and redo commands.

*4.1.1* Forced Pairs                                           *pt-forced-pairs*

This is somewhat a sub-feature to auto-close. This feature was added after
thinking the best way to handle Python DOCSTRINGS, or similar constructs in
other languages.

Using the <M-openingpairchar> key sequence while in insert mode will add an 
auto-closed pairs even inside antimagic fields. The following example uses 
Python DOCSTRING but any pair can be nested inside antimagic fields:

    Pressing "     =>  "|"
    Pressing <M-"> =>  ""|""
    Pressing <M-"> =>  """|"""

It is still possible to step out pressing three times the closing pair.

In some terminals, the META-key (or ALT-key) isn't properly supported. For
users in this situation, it is possible to use <C-key> followed by the opening 
character of a pair, where key is the key the user defines using the 
forced-pair option. Example: >

        let g:{filetype}_forcedpairskey = "<C-L>". 
<
From the previous <M-"> example:

    Pressing "      =>  "|"
    Pressing <C-L>" =>  ""|""
    Pressing <C-L>" =>  """|"""

This options has two purposes: 
        - <Bar> cannot be mapped to META-key. By default, it uses the mapping
          <C-\><Bar>. Remapping the key will use the user defined <C-key>
          instead of <C-\>.
        - In some terminal the META is not well supported and will allow the
          user to still use the feature with new <C-key> mappings.

Note: This feature is compatible with the undo and redo commands.

*4.2* Antimagic Field                                      *pt-antimagic-field*

This feature prevents the PairTools plugin to operate some of its magic over
certain syntax fields. This is particularly useful inside comments and 
strings. The syntax fields are specified using the antimagicfield options.

When antimagic is enabled, the following features will be disabled inside the
defined fields:

        - Auto-closing/Moving out
        - Pair deletion

The quotes need special handlings with regard to the String syntax field. More
information is provided in the |special-handlings| section. It is still
possible to move out of some field when on the field delimiter, such as the
ending quote of a string.

*4.3* Smart-Close                                               *pt-pair-close*

This feature allow the user to tell the plugin conditions under which it
should not automatically close a defined pair. To specify the conditions, the
user must specify a regex-like string. This string must be in single quote
unless the user wants to escape each backslashes.

The smart close uses commas delimited string between which single character
pattern items are defined. The only non-stardard items is the ^ which
represent the current opening character of a pair being pressed.

By default, the PairTools plugin uses '\w,^'. This means that it will not
automatically close the pair when there is a WORD character or the same
opening character of a defined-pair on the left.


Basic regex-like "rules" would be:

        ^       Any opening character of a defined pair
        \w      Any WORD character
        \$      The dollar sign
        \*      The star sign
        \^      The uparrow sign
        Any Character that requires no escaping in regular expression.

Here is a example: >

        let g:cpp_smartclosefield = '^,\w,\*,&'
<

*4.4* Pair Deletion                                          *pt-pair-deletion*

This feature allows the deletion of an empty pair. For example, assume the
user typed the following line:

	int function[|]

He has mistakenly type '[' instead of '('. To removed the brackets, the user 
only need to press the backspace key to delete both the opening '[' and the
closing ']':

	int function|

Note: This feature is compatible with the undo and redo commands.

*4.5* Surround                                                    *pt-surround*

This feature has two modes: inline and block. It is triggered in Vim Visual 
Mode by selecting text or line(s) the user wants to surround and by pressing 
the opening character of a defined pair to surround it (them) with that pair.

The inline mode is used to surround a sequence of character within a line.
Suppose you want to surround the word not with double quotes in the following 
sentence:

	To be or not to be, that is the question!

The user would select the characters 'n', 'o', 't', with either the mouse or
by hitting the sequence "v-e" and press the double quote key:

	To be or "not" to be, that is the question!

Selecting the characters of a whole line can be tricky and can result in a 
block surround even though the intent was to use the inline surround. This
will be discussed after the presentation of the block mode.

The block mode is used to add, above and below a block of text, the opening 
and closing characters of a pair respectively. Suppose the user has the 
following bit of C code and wants to put it between new braces {}.

	int editor = 846
        int funfactor = 313
	vim = (editor << 2) + c

All the user has to do is to select the three lines of code and press '{'.

	{
	    int editor = 846
	    int funfactor = 313
	    vim = (editor << 2) + c
	}

Not only does the block mode surround the piece of code with braces, but also
adjust the indentation based on Vim local 'shiftwidth' option.

As said earlier, selecting all characters in a single line can lead to
confusion and here is why. When the user select a line with "SHIFT-v" or using 
the combination "v-$" from anywhere inside the line, it actually selects an 
invisible character at the end of line which is the EOL character. This tells 
the plugin the user wants to use block surrounding. 

To avoid this confusion when inline surround is needed, the user must use the 
'v' key to select all characters but the EOL. One could put the cursor at the 
first character of a line and press "v-$-h" to bring the selection on the last 
visible character. This way the inline mode will be used for the entire line.

Note: This feature is compatible with the undo and redo commands.

*4.6* Carriage Return Expansion                  *pt-carriage-return-expansion*

This feature is quite simple. Once the plugin has auto-closed a pair the user
can press the enter key to have the opening character above the cursor and the
closing character below the cursor. The cursor is indented. Suppose the user
simple press '{':

	{|}

With the cursor inside the empty pair, the user can press the enter key to
have the following result:

	{
	    |
	}

The indentation is based on the local 'shiftwidth' option.

Note: This feature is compatible with the undo and redo commands.

*4.7* Special Handlings                                  *pt-special-handlings*

This section contains information about the special handling of some pairs.

When expressing a string with a double quote, it is possible to add a double 
quote between string double quote delimiters when it is preceded by a 
backslash. 

Suppose the user wants to write the following: 

        string str = "\""

The user must type:

        1. string str = "|"
        2. string str = "\|"
        3. string str = "\"|"
        4. string str = "\""|  (Press double once more)

If the backslash is omitted, the user will step out of the string and he will
have an empty string. When the backslash is preceded by another backslash,
such that the expression would looks like:

        string str = "\\|"

Pressing the double quote will result into stepping out.

The single quote string is limited when inserting another single quote within.
It is not possible to add a single quote on the last character of the string,
as it will automatically step out.

A single quote can be used as an apostrophe in a string using single quotes
delimiter if and only if there is another one beside. To achieve this, the 
user should use the |forced-pairs| sub-feature.

==============================================================================
*5.* Installation                                       *pairtools-install*

The PairTools plugin is easily installed. Just drop the pairtools.vim into the
user plugin directory and the pairtools.txt into the doc directory.

To install the help file, use the following command inside Vim: >
    
        :helptags ~/.vim/doc            (Linux)
        :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc    (Windows)
<
Now all that remains is to set the features options per filetypes using the 
{filetypename}.vim files inside the user ftplugin directory.

==============================================================================
*6.* Filetype Files Examples                            *pairtools-examples*

C++ File Example

The following example is what could be set to use all feature with C++ files.
It is assumed that the plugin is globally enabled. This code must be insert
into cpp.vim or similar filename understood by Vim as being C++ related inside
the 'runtimepath' first folder: >

        " Enable PairTools for CPP
        let g:cpp_pairtools = 1

        " Set pairs for Auto-Close and Forced-Pair
        let g:cpp_autoclose = 1
        let g:cpp_closepairs = "[:],{:},(:),':',\":\""

        " Set syntax field preventing some PairTools magic
        let g:cpp_antimagic = 1
        let g:cpp_antimagicfield = "Comment,String,Special,Constant"

        " Set Smart-Close rules as {pairs, WORD character, *, &)
        let g:cpp_smartclose = 1
        let g:cpp_smartcloserules = '^,\w,\*,&'

        " Enable pair deletion and CR expansion
        let g:cpp_pairdeletion = 1
        let g:cpp_crexpand = 1

        " Enable surround
        let g:cpp_surround = 1
<

Vim Help File Examples

The following example set feature for Vim Help File filetype. It should be
inserted in help.vim file or a similar filename:  >

        " Enable PairTools for this file-type
        let g:help_pairtools = 1

        " Set pairs for
        let g:help_autoclose = 1
        let g:help_closepairs = "*:*,|:|,':'"

        " No syntax fields
        let g:help_antimagic = 0
        let g:help_antimagicfield = ""

        " Use smart pairs
        let g:help_smartclose = 1
        let g:help_smartcloserules = '^,\w'

        " Enable pair deletion and disable CR expansion
        let g:help_pairdeletion = 1
        let g:help_crexpand = 0

        " Enable surround
        let g:help_surround = 1
<

It is a good practice to set options enable even thought they are all enabled
by default, as in subsequent version they could be all disabled by default.

Notes: The default values are set to properly work with Vim Script filetype.

==============================================================================
*7.* Few Thoughts                                       *pairtools-thoughts*

- Using the repeat command '.' with |auto-close| doesn't work as expected by a 
  user. The closing character will not appear even though the user type the
  ending character to step out of the pair.

- Currently, when editing a Vim Script, pressing the double quote to start a
  comment will auto-close it with another double quote.

- Syntaxes with which the PairTools plugin was tested are: 

        C, C++, VHDL, Vim Help and Vim Script.

- I've tried the following "multi-character pairs" used in web development 
  languages such as PHP and Ruby and they seem to work fine with the 
  auto-close feature without special support:

        <% %> | <? ?>

  Even thought these ones work, the plugin isn't design with the purpose of
  supporting multi-character pairs. They will auto-close but the other
  features won't work as expected. There is no plan to support multi-character 
  pairs at this moment. You can possibly work around this limitation by
  specifying the pairs "<:>,%:%,?:?" which are expect to work properly with
  all features.

==============================================================================
